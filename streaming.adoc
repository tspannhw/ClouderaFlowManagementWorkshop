= From Edge to Streams Processing

In this workshop you'll implement a data pipeline, using MiNiFi and NiFi to ingest data from an IoT device into Kafka and then consume data from Kafka and write it to Kudu tables.

== Labs summary

* *Lab 1* - On the Apache NiFi, obtain data
* *Lab 2* - On the NiFi cluster, prepare the data, process each record save results to **Kudu**.

[[lab_1, Lab 1]]
== Lab 1 - Apache NiFi: obtain data

In this lab you will run a simple Python script that simulates IoT sensor data from some hypothetical machines, and send the data to a MQTT broker (link:https://mosquitto.org/[mosquitto]). The MQTT broker plays the role of a gateway that is connected to many and different type of sensors through the "mqtt" protocol. Your cluster comes with an embedded MQTT broker that the simulation script publishes to. For convenience, we will use NiFi to run the script rather than Shell commands.

. Go to Apache NiFi and add a Processor (ExecuteProcess) to the canvas.

== Lab 2 - Configuring Edge Flow Management

Cloudera Edge Flow Management gives you a visual overview of all MiNiFi agents in your environment, and allows you to update the flow configuration for each one, with versioning control thanks to the **NiFi Registry** integration. In this lab, you will create the MiNiFi flow and publish it for the MiNiFi agent to pick it up.

. Open the EFM Web UI at http://<public_dns>:10080/efm/ui/. Ensure you see your minifi agent's heartbeat messages in the **Events Monitor**. Click on the info icon on a heartbeat record to see the details of the heartbeat.
+
image::images/cem_heartbeats.png[width=800]

. You can then select the **Flow Designer** tab (image:images/flow_designer_icon.png[width=30]). To build a dataflow, select the desired class (`iot-1`) from the table and click *OPEN*.  Alternatively, you can double-click on the desired class.

. Add a _ConsumeMQTT_ Processor to the canvas, by dragging the processor icon to the canvas, selecting the _ConsumeMQTT_ processor type and clicking on the *Add* button. Once the processor is on the canvas, double-click it and configure it with below settings:
+
[source]
----
Broker URI:     tcp://edge2ai-1.dim.local:1883
Client ID:      minifi-iot
Topic Filter:   iot/#
Max Queue Size: 60
----
+
image::images/add_consumer_mqtt.png[width=800]
+
And ensure you scroll down on the properties page to set the *Topic Filter* and *Max Queue Size*:
+
image::images/add_consumer_mqtt_2.png[width=800]

. Add a _Remote Process Group_ (RPG) to the canvas and configure it as follows:
+
[source]
----
URL:                http://edge2ai-1.dim.local:8080/nifi
Transport Protocol: HTTP
----
+
image::images/add_rpg.png[width=800]

. At this point you need to connect the ConsumerMQTT processor to the RPG. For this, you first need to add an Input Port to the remote NiFi server. Open the NiFi Web UI at `\http://<public_dns>:8080/nifi/` and drag the _Input Port_ to the canvas. Call it something like "from Gateway".
+
image::images/add_input_port.png[width=800]

. To terminate the NiFI _Input Port_ let's, for now, add a _Funnel_ to the canvas...
+
image::images/add_funnel.png[width=600]

. ... and setup a connection from the Input Port to it. To setup a connection, hover the mouse over the Input Port until an arrow symbol is shown in the center. Click on the arrow, drag it and drop it on the Funnel to connect the two elements.
+
image::images/connecting.png[width=800]

. Right-click on the Input Port and start it. Alternatively, click on the Input Port to select it and then press the start ("play") button on the Operate panel:
+
image::images/operate_panel.png[width=300]

. You will need the ID of the _Input Port_ to complete the connection of the _ConsumeMQTT_ processor to the RPG (NiFi). Double-click on the _Input Port_ and copy its ID.
+
image::images/input_port_id.png[width=800]

. Back to the Flow Designer, connect the ConsumeMQTT processor to the RPG. The connection requires an ID and you can paste here the ID you copied from the Input Port. *Make sure that there are NO SPACES*!
+
image::images/connect_to_rpg.png[width=800]
+
Double-click the connection to check the configuration:
+
image::images/efmSetCloudConfiguration.png[width=400]

. The Flow is now complete, but before publishing it, create the Bucket in the _NiFi Registry_ so that all versions of your flows are stored for review and audit. Open the NiFi Registry at `\http://<public_dns>:18080/nifi-registry`, click on the wrench/spanner icon (image:images/spanner_icon.png[width=20]) on the top-right corner on and create a bucket called `IoT` (*ATTENTION*: the bucket name is *CASE-SENSITIVE*).
+
image::images/create_bucket.png[width=800]

. You can now publish the flow for the MiNiFi agent to automatically pick up. Click *Publish*, add a descriptive comment for your changes and click *Apply*.
+
image::images/publish_flow.png[width=800]
+
image::images/cem_first_version.png[width=800]


. Go back to the *NiFi Registry* Web UI and click on the *NiFi Registry* name, next to the Cloudera logo. If the flow publishing was successful, you should see the flow's version details in the NiFi Registry.
+
image::images/flow_in_nifi_registry.png[width=800]

. At this point, you can test the edge flow up until NiFi. Start the NiFi simulator (ExecuteProcess processor) again and confirm you can see the messages queued in NiFi.
+
image::images/queued_events.png[width=300]

. You can stop the simulator (Stop the NiFi processor) once you confirm that the flow is working correctly.

== Lab 2 - Configuring the NiFi flow 

In this lab, you will create a NiFi flow to receive the data from all gateways and push it to **Kafka**.

=== Creating a Process Group

Before we start building our flow, let's create a Process Group to help organizing the flows in the NiFi canvas and also to enable flow version control.

. Open the NiFi Web UI, create a new Process Group and name it something like *Process Sensor Data*.
+
image::images/create_pgroup.png[width=800]

. We want to be able to version control the flows we will add to the Process Group. In order to do that, we first need to connect NiFi to the *NiFi Registry*. On the NiFi global menu, click on "Controller Settings", navigate to the "Registry Clients" tab and add a Registry client with the following URL:
+
----
Name: NiFi Registry
URL:  http://edge2ai-1.dim.local:18080
----
+
image::images/global_controller_settings.png[width=800]
+
image::images/add_registry_client.png[width=800]

. On the *NiFi Registry* Web UI, add another bucket for storing the Sensor flow we're about to build'. Call it `SensorFlows`:
+
image::images/sensor_flows_bucket.png[width=800]

. Back on the *NiFi* Web UI, to enable version control for the Process Group, right-click on it and select *Version > Start version control* and enter the details below. Once you complete, a image:images/version_control_tick.png[width=20] will appear on the Process Group, indicating that version control is now enabled for it.
+
[source]
----
Registry:  NiFi Registry
Bucket:    SensorFlows
Flow Name: SensorProcessGroup
----

. Let's also enable processors in this Process Group to use schemas stored in Schema Registry. Right-click on the Process Group, select *Configure* and navigate to the *Controller Services* tab. Click the *`+`* icon and add a *HortonworksSchemaRegistry* service. After the service is added, click on the service's _cog_ icon (image:images/cog_icon.png[width=20]), go to the *Properties* tab and configure it with the following *Schema Registry URL* and click *Apply*.
+
[source]
----
URL: http://edge2ai-1.dim.local:7788/api/v1
----
+
image::images/added_hwx_sr_service.png[width=800]

. Click on the _lightning bolt_ icon (image:images/enable_icon.png[width=20]) to *enable* the *HortonworksSchemaRegistry* Controller Service.

. Still on the *Controller Services* screen, let's add two additional services to handle the reading and writing of JSON records. Click on the image:images/plus_button.png[width=25] button and add the following two services:
** *`JsonTreeReader`*, with the following properties:
+
[source]
----
Schema Access Strategy: Use 'Schema Name' Property
Schema Registry:        HortonworksSchemaRegistry
Schema Name:            ${schema.name} -> already set by default!
----

** *`JsonRecordSetWriter`*, with the following properties:
+
[source]
----
Schema Write Strategy:  HWX Schema Reference Attributes
Schema Access Strategy: Use 'Schema Name' Property
Schema Registry:        HortonworksSchemaRegistry
----

. Enable the *JsonTreeReader* and the *JsonRecordSetWriter* Controller Services you just created, by clicking on their respective _lightning bolt_ icons (image:images/enable_icon.png[width=20]).
+
image::images/controller_services.png[width=800]

=== Creating the flow

. Double-click on the newly created process group to expand it.

. Inside the process group, add a new _Input Port_ and name it "Sensor Data"

. We need to tell NiFi which schema should be used to read and write the Sensor data. For this we'll use an _UpdateAttribute_ processor to add an attribute to the FlowFile indicating the schema name.
+
Add an _UpdateAttribute_ processor by dragging the processor icon to the canvas:
+
image::images/add_updateattribute.png[width=800]

. Double-click the _UpdateAttribute_ processor and configure it as follows:
.. In the _SETTINGS_ tab:
+
[source]
----
Name: Set Schema Name
----
.. In the _PROPERTIES_ tab:
** Click on the image:images/plus_button.png[width=25] button and add the following property:
+
[source]
----
Property Name:  schema.name
Property Value: SensorReading
----
